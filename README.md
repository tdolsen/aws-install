AWS Install scripts
===================

This is an collection of quick and easy bash scripts used to set up a fresh
Amason AWS server with the stack of your choice.

(Well.. at the moment there isn't really an "collection", as there only is one
install script. More will probably come.)

Installation/Usage
------------------

The scripts are quite easy to use, and should be possible to run, only using
curl. The following is an example of how to run the directly from the GitHub
repository:
`curl https://raw.github.com/tdolsen/aws-install/master/wanted-script.sh | sh`
(You would of course have to change `wanted-script` to the wanted script.)
